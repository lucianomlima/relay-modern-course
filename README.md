`yarn setup` is first one

## Are there videos to accompany the slides?
Not yet, if I receive enough donations to buy a microphone I will record the course.

Those who donate will receive the course for free.

## This is a course for a web client, is there a default server to be used with it?
Yes! Thanks to [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) you can get a server up and running easily!

Just go here: https://github.com/BigsonLvrocha/relay-modern-typescript-server and follow the instructions in the `README`.
